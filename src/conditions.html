        <h3 class="text-f20 font-bold text-white mb-2 mt-4">1) Scope</h3>
        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3">1.1 These General Terms and Conditions (hereinafter “Terms and
          Conditions”) of FRBO GmbH (hereinafter “Seller”) apply to
          all contracts for the delivery of goods that a consumer or entrepreneur (hereinafter “Customer”) enters into
          with the
          Seller regarding the terms and conditions specified by the Seller in his online -Shop completes the goods
          shown. The
          inclusion of the customer's own terms and conditions is hereby objected to, unless otherwise agreed.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3">1.2 These General Terms and Conditions apply accordingly to contracts
          for the delivery of vouchers, unless
          otherwise
          stipulated. </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 1.3 These General Terms and Conditions apply accordingly to contracts
          for the provision of digital content,
          unless
          otherwise stipulated. Digital content within the meaning of these General Terms and Conditions is data that is
          created
          and provided in digital form. </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 1.4 A consumer within the meaning of these General Terms and
          Conditions is any natural person who concludes a
          legal
          transaction for purposes that cannot be predominantly attributed to either their commercial or independent
          professional
          activity. </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 1.5 An entrepreneur within the meaning of these General Terms and
          Conditions is a natural or legal person or a
          partnership with legal capacity who, when concluding a legal transaction, acts in the exercise of their
          commercial or
          independent professional activity. </p>
        <h3 class="text-f20 font-bold text-white mb-2 mt-4">2) Conclusion of contract</h3>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3">2.1 The product descriptions contained in the seller's online shop do
          not represent binding offers on the part
          of the
          seller, but rather serve to make a binding offer by the customer.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 2.2 The customer can submit the offer using the online order form
          integrated into the seller's online shop.
          After
          placing the selected goods in the virtual shopping cart and going through the electronic ordering process, the
          customer
          submits a legally binding contractual offer with regard to the goods contained in the shopping cart by
          clicking
          on the
          button that completes the ordering process.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 2.3 The seller can accept the customer's offer within five days,</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> by sending the customer a written order confirmation or an order
          confirmation in text form (fax or email),
          whereby the
          receipt of the order confirmation by the customer is decisive, or
          by delivering the ordered goods to the customer, whereby the receipt of the goods by the customer is decisive,
          or
          by asking the customer to pay after placing their order.
          If several of the aforementioned alternatives are present, the contract is concluded at the point in time at
          which one
          of the aforementioned alternatives occurs first. The period for accepting the offer begins on the day after
          the
          customer
          sends the offer and ends at the end of the fifth day following the sending of the offer. If the seller does
          not
          accept
          the customer's offer within the aforementioned period, this is deemed to be a rejection of the offer with the
          result
          that the customer is no longer bound by his declaration of intent.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 2.4 If you select a payment method offered by PayPal, payment is
          processed via the payment service provider
          PayPal
          (Europe) S.à rl et Cie, SCA, 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg (hereinafter: “PayPal”), under the
          jurisdiction of
          PayPal -Terms of use, which can be viewed at https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full or -
          if
          the
          customer does not have a PayPal account - subject to the conditions for payments without a PayPal account, can
          be viewed
          at https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacywax-full . If the customer pays using a payment method
          offered by
          PayPal that can be selected during the online ordering process, the seller declares acceptance of the
          customer's
          offer
          at the moment the customer clicks the button that completes the ordering process.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 2.5 When submitting an offer via the seller's online order form, the
          contract text is saved by the seller after
          the
          contract has been concluded and sent to the customer in text form (e.g. e-mail, fax or letter) after the order
          has been
          sent. The seller will not make the contract text available beyond this. If the customer has set up a user
          account in the
          seller's online shop before sending his order, the order data will be archived on the seller's website and can
          be
          accessed free of charge by the customer via his password-protected user account by providing the relevant
          login
          details.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 2.6 Before bindingly submitting the order via the seller's online
          order form, the customer can identify possible
          input
          errors by carefully reading the information displayed on the screen. An effective technical means of better
          detecting
          input errors can be the browser's magnification function, which enlarges the display on the screen. As part of
          the
          electronic ordering process, the customer can correct his entries using the usual keyboard and mouse functions
          until he
          clicks on the button that completes the ordering process.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 2.7 Only the German language is available for concluding the contract.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 2.8 Order processing and contact usually take place via email and
          automated order processing. The customer must
          ensure
          that the email address he provided to process the order is correct so that emails sent by the seller can be
          received at
          this address. In particular, when using SPAM filters, the customer must ensure that all emails sent by the
          seller or by
          third parties commissioned by the seller to process the order can be delivered. </p>

        <h3 class="text-f20 font-bold text-white mb-2 mt-4">3) Right of withdrawal</h3>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 3.1 Consumers generally have a right of withdrawal.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 3.2 Further information on the right of withdrawal can be found in the
          seller's cancellation policy.</p>

        <h3 class="text-f20 font-bold text-white mb-2 mt-4">4) Prices and payment terms</h3>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 4.1 Unless otherwise stated in the seller's product description, the
          prices stated are total prices and include
          statutory sales tax. Any additional delivery and shipping costs that may arise will be stated separately in
          the
          respective product description. </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 4.2 The payment option(s) will be communicated to the customer in the
          seller's online shop. </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 4.3 If you select a payment method offered via the “PayPal” payment
          service, payment is processed via PayPal, although
          PayPal can also use the services of third-party payment service providers for this purpose. If the seller also
          offers
          payment methods via PayPal in which he makes advance payments to the customer (e.g. purchase on account or
          payment in
          installments), he assigns his payment claim to PayPal or to the payment service provider commissioned by
          PayPal and
          specifically named to the customer. Before accepting the seller's declaration of assignment, PayPal or the
          payment
          service provider commissioned by PayPal carries out a credit check using the customer data transmitted. The
          seller
          reserves the right to refuse the customer the selected payment method in the event of a negative check result.
          If the
          selected payment method is approved, the customer must pay the invoice amount within the agreed payment period
          or at the
          agreed payment intervals. In this case, he can only make payments to PayPal or the payment service provider
          commissioned
          by PayPal with a debt-discharging effect. However, even in the event of the assignment of claims, the seller
          remains
          responsible for general customer inquiries, e.g. B. about the goods, delivery time, shipping, returns,
          complaints,
          cancellation declarations and shipments or credit notes. </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 4.4 If you select a payment method offered via the “Stripe” payment
          service, payment is processed via the payment
          service provider Stripe Payments Europe Ltd., 1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin, Ireland
          (hereinafter
          “Stripe”). The individual payment methods offered via Stripe are communicated to the customer in the seller's
          online
          shop. To process payments, Stripe may use other payment services to which special payment conditions may
          apply, to which
          the customer may be notified separately. Further information about Stripe is available online at
          https://stripe.com/de . </p>

        <h3 class="text-f20 font-bold text-white mb-2 mt-4">5) Delivery and shipping conditions</h3>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 5.1 If the seller offers to ship the goods, delivery will take place
          within the delivery area specified by the
          seller to
          the delivery address specified by the customer, unless otherwise agreed. When processing the transaction, the
          delivery
          address specified in the seller's order processing is decisive.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 5.2 If delivery of the goods fails for reasons for which the customer
          is responsible, the customer shall bear
          the
          reasonable costs incurred by the seller as a result. This does not apply with regard to the shipping costs if
          the
          customer effectively exercises his right of cancellation. If the customer effectively exercises the right of
          cancellation, the return shipping costs will be subject to the provisions set out in the seller's cancellation
          policy.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 5.3 If the customer acts as an entrepreneur, the risk of accidental
          loss and accidental deterioration of the
          goods sold
          passes to the customer as soon as the seller has delivered the item to the freight forwarder, the freight
          carrier or the
          person or institution otherwise designated to carry out the shipment. If the customer acts as a consumer, the
          risk of
          accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the goods sold is generally only transferred when the goods
          are
          handed
          over to the customer or a person authorized to receive them. Deviating from this, the risk of accidental loss
          and
          accidental deterioration of the goods sold, even for consumers, passes to the customer as soon as the seller
          has
          delivered the item to the freight forwarder, the freight carrier or the person or institution otherwise
          designated to
          carry out the shipment, if the The customer commissions the freight forwarder, the freight forwarder or the
          other person
          or institution designated to carry out the shipment to carry out the shipment and the seller has not
          previously
          named
          this person or institution to the customer.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 5.4 The seller reserves the right to withdraw from the contract in the
          event of incorrect or improper delivery.
          This
          only applies in the event that the non-delivery is not the fault of the seller and the seller has concluded a
          specific
          cover transaction with the supplier with due care. The seller will make all reasonable efforts to procure the
          goods. In
          the event of non-availability or only partial availability of the goods, the customer will be informed
          immediately and
          the consideration will be refunded immediately.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 5.5 Self-collection is not possible for logistical reasons.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 5.6 Vouchers are provided to the customer as follows:</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> by email</p>
        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> by post</p>
        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 5.7 Digital content is provided to the customer as follows:</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> – via direct access via the entrepreneur’s website</p>


        <h3 class="text-f20 font-bold text-white mb-2 mt-4">6) Granting of usage rights for digital content</h3>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 6.1 Unless otherwise stated in the description of the content in the
          seller's online shop, the seller grants the
          customer the non-exclusive right, unrestricted in terms of location and time, to use the content provided
          exclusively
          for private purposes. </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 6.2 Passing on the content to third parties or making copies for third
          parties outside the scope of these
          General Terms
          and Conditions is not permitted unless the seller has agreed to transfer the contractual license to the third
          party. </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 6.3 If the contract refers to the one-off provision of digital
          content, the granting of rights will only become
          effective once the customer has paid the remuneration owed in full. The seller can also provisionally allow
          the
          use of
          the contractual contents before this point in time. A transfer of rights does not take place through such a
          provisional
          permission. </p>


        <h3 class="text-f20 font-bold text-white mb-2 mt-4">7) Retention of title</h3>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> If the seller makes advance payments, he reserves ownership of the
          delivered goods until the purchase price owed has
          been paid in full.</p>


        <h3 class="text-f20 font-bold text-white mb-2 mt-4">8) Liability for defects (warranty)</h3>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 8.1 Unless otherwise stated in the following regulations, the
          provisions of statutory liability for defects apply.
          Deviating from this, the following applies to contracts for the delivery of goods: </p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3"> 8.2 If the customer acts as an entrepreneur, </p>

        <ul class="text-f16  mb-3 list-disc text-lightGrey ml-5">
          <li>the seller has the choice of the type of supplementary performance;</li>
          <li>For new goods, the limitation period for defects is one year from delivery of the goods;</li>
          <li>In the case of used goods, rights and claims due to defects are excluded;</li>
          <li> The statute of limitations does not begin again if a replacement delivery is made within the scope of
            liability
            for
            defects.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16  mb-3">
          8.3 The limitations of liability and shortening of deadlines regulated above do not apply
        </p>

        <ul class="text-f16  mb-3 list-disc text-lightGrey ml-5">
          <li>for claims for damages and reimbursement of expenses by the customer,</li>


          <li>in the event that the seller fraudulently concealed the defect,</li>
          <li>for goods that have been used for a building in accordance with their normal use and have caused its
            defects,</li>
          <li> for any obligation of the seller to provide updates for digital products, in contracts for the delivery

            goods

          limitation periods for any existing legal recourse claim
          remain
          unaffected.</p>


        <p class="text-f16  mb-3 list-disc text-lightGrey"> 8.5 If the customer acts as a merchant within the meaning of

        <p class="text-f16  mb-3 list-disc text-lightGrey"> The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies to all
          legal relationships between the parties, excluding the
          laws on
          the international purchase of movable goods. For consumers, this choice of law only applies to the extent that
          the
          protection granted is not withdrawn by mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which the consumer
          has
          his or
          her habitual residence. </p>

        <h3 class="text-f20 font-bold text-white mb-2 mt-4">12) Place of jurisdiction</h3>

        <p class="text-f16  mb-3 list-disc text-lightGrey"> If the customer acts as a merchant, a legal entity under
          public law or a special fund under public law based in
          the
          Federal Republic of Germany, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract
          is
          the
          seller's place of business. If the customer is based outside the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany,
          the
          seller's place of business is the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract
          if
          the
          contract or claims arising from the contract can be attributed to the customer's professional or commercial
          activity. In
          the above cases, however, the seller is in any case entitled to appeal to the court at the customer's
          registered
          office.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-f20 font-bold text-white mb-2 mt-4">13) Alternative Dispute Resolution</h3>
