        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16 mb-3"> Within our online offering, we use the “Facebook Pixel” service from

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16 mb-3"> If a user clicks on an ad we place on Facebook, the URL of our linked
          page is expanded by a parameter using
          “Facebook
          Pixel”. After redirection, this URL parameter is then entered into the user's browser through a cookie that
          our
          linked
          page sets itself. In addition, this cookie collects specific customer data such as the email address, which we
          collect
          on our website linked to the Facebook ad during processes such as purchasing, account logins or registrations
          (extended
          data matching). The cookie is then read and enables the data, including specific customer data, to be
          transmitted to

          whether users were redirected to our website

          clicking on an advertisement (conversion). Compared to the standard version of “Facebook Pixel,” the advanced
          data
          matching feature helps us better measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns by tracking more
          attributed
          conversions.</p>

          interesting for you and to achieve a fair calculation of the advertising costs incurred.</p>

        <p class="text-lightGrey text-f16 mb-3"> The conversion tracking cookie is set when a user clicks on an Ads ad
          placed by Google. Cookies are small text
          files
          that are stored on your device. These cookies usually expire after 30 days and are not used for personal
          identification.
          If the user visits certain pages on this website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can
          recognize
          that

          Cookies cannot therefore be tracked via the websites of Google Ads customers. The information collected using
          the

          of an interactive user interface on which consent can be given for certain cookies and/or cookie-based

          user
          gives
          their consent by checking the box. This ensures that such cookies are only set on the user's device if consent
          has been
